 Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains code and documentation for the Iris Flower Classification project. The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their measurements.

## Project Overview

The Iris Flower dataset consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample contains four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The task is to classify the species of an iris flower based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from the Scikit-learn library or downloaded from [here](link_to_dataset).

- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
